<h1 align="center">notes 0.5</h1>

**notes 0.5** is my first project that I started working on right after I learned the basics of the JAVA language. It is not perfect, but I wrote it in such a way that everyone could understand it, even people who are just starting their adventure with JAVA.
I added a lot of tips, comments, to let you know what the function does, if you have any questions or want to report a bug, please DM me.
